Yes, even if it is sent in a paper format!<br><br> As for the company, it can create a career page and make it available in all existing talent acquisition channels (Website, hiring site, social networks and others). This allows the company to obtain live updates of their profile via the cloud, thanks to our new technology of active candidates. To save a huge amount of time by filtering people available or not and joining them in any existing ways (email, mobile notification, messenger, etc.).<br><br> The key to the JobMap platform is that it allows us to add features such as pre video-interview or artificial intelligence classification, in an organic and fast way. All will benefit because we do not restrict access to these features for the average user or business.<br><br> We democratize the power of Human Resources by providing all the necessary tools for the acquisition of talent. We allow the smallest company that does not have the financial means to post positions and locations on our FREE search engine.<br><br> We help candidates by providing them with a resume creation tool and a job search engine that matches the lifestyle of 21st century people.
